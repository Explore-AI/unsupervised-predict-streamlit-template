Collaborative filtering analyzes user behavior and identifies users with similar preferences to generate recommendations. Content-based filtering focuses on the attributes of movies themselves and suggests items with similar characteristics to those the user has liked in the past."),

They help users discover new movies that match their interests, leading to enhanced user satisfaction and engagement. For movie platforms, recommender systems can increase user retention, improve movie ratings, and drive revenue through increased movie consumption."),

                    ("What is collaborative filtering?","Collaborative filtering is a technique where the recommender system identifies users with similar preferences and recommends items liked by those similar users. It relies on user-item interaction data, such as user ratings or purchase history, to make predictions about users' preferences."),
                    ("How does content-based filtering work?","Content-based filtering recommends items based on the features or characteristics of the items themselves. For example, in a movie recommender system, it might recommend movies with similar genres, actors, or themes to those the user has shown interest in.")
