				<a>In this project we were given two approaches that acted as a starting point, namely collerborative and content based filtering.</a>
				<br></br>
				<ul><li>Content based filtering: uses item features to recommend similar items to the ones that a user has previously liked or interacted with.</li><li>Collaborative filtering: identifies items that a user will like based on how similar users rated each item. Netflix identifies shows and movies users will enjoy by determining which content similar users&nbsp;watched.</li></ul>
				<br></br>
				<p>As a Team we decided on developing a collaborative filtering recommender engine, we will only look at the building process of a CF model<p>
				<h3>Requirements To Get Started</h3>
				<p>To build the Model for recommender, we used these packages: Pandas, numpy, Surprise, a Python scikit package built for collaborative filtering</p>
				<h3>Surprise<h3>
				<p>
					we used suprise's built in user-ratings matrix conversion, we started supplying a train dataframe that contains a user id column, an item id column, and a rating column.
					From there, Surprise helped us generate a user-ratings matrix where each user id is a row and each movie the company offers is a column. This had the same impact as creating a Pandas pivot table. We then divided the dataframe into a train and test set with an 80/20 split.
				</p>
				<h3>algorithms</h3>
				<p>
				   Surprise offers 11 different prediction algorithms including variations of KNN and dimensionality reduction techniques such as SVD and NMF. For this demonstration, we ended up using svd. 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>SVD: A matrix factorization technique popularized by Simon Funk as part of the Netflix prize.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Model Accessment</h3>
				<p>
					There are two ways to assess model performance. Qualitatively, you can look at a given user and determine if the recommendation makes sense given other products they like. For example, if someone likes horror movies and doesnâ€™t like romantic comedies, The Shining would be a good recommendation relative to Love Actually. For this dataset, we did not have information about each product, only a movie id so we used a quantitative measure, root mean squared error. A combination of the two methods is ideal, though a quantitive measure is much more realistic in production
				</p>
				<h3>Model Tuning</h3>
				<p>The surprise package offers an option to tune parameters using GridSearchCV. We provided GridSearchCV with a dictionary of parameters and the rmse will be calculated and compared for every combination of the parameters.</p>

					In this project, we succeeded in building an unsupervised machine learning model that is able to recommend movies based on content-based or collaborative filtering and is capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, based on their historical preferences. Our top performing model has a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.78, based on a testing set submitted to the EDSA Kaggle competition.

					The singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm is a baseline approach to recommender systems, as it has a broad range of applications including dimensionality reduction, solving linear inverse problems, and data fitting. The SVD algorithm generally performs better on large datasets compared to some other models as it decomposes a matrix into constituent arrays of feature vectors corresponding to each row and each column.
