The notion is to create a seamless process that increases the chance of going with the best choice in every scenario. The application of recommender system is pronounced in email spam classification and movie title selections. In this project, the goal is to develop a model that can help viewers get the best title from thousands of movie titles.  \n\nThe key objectives of the project include:\n* Develop a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering. \n* The model predict how an individual will rate a movie based on historical movie selection patterns.\n* The model should demonstrate the potential to be applied to create an economically robust system that enables users to have a personalized recommendaation system for a daily use.
