## **What is a movie recommender system?**  

The sole purpose of a recommender system is to suggest users something based on their interest or usage history, in this case movies. It employs a statistical algorithm that seeks to predict users' ratings for certain movies, based on the similarity between the movies or similarity between the users that previously rated those movies. The intuition is that similar types of users are likely to have similar ratings for a set of movies.

Data required for movie recommender systems stems from explicit user ratings after watching a movie, the number of views a movie got and from implicit search engine queries and, or from other knowledge about the users/items themselves.

They are among the most powerful machine learning systems that online movie platforms implement in order to increase views on their sites and ultimately drive sales.
