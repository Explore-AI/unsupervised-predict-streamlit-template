## Why do we need movie recommender systems?
Companies who run movie sites using recommender systems focus on customer/user retention as a result of very personalized offers and an enhanced customer experience.
Recommendations typically speed up searches and make it easier for users to access movie content they are interested in, and surprise them with movie suggestions they would have never searched for.

What is more, companies are able to gain and retain customers by sending out emails with links to new movies that meet the recipients' interests, or suggestions of films and TV shows that suit their profiles.

The user starts to feel known and understood and is more likely to consume more content. By knowing what a user wants, the company gains competitive advantage and the threat of losing a customer to a competitor decreases.
Providing that added value to users by including recommendations in systems and products is appealing. Furthermore, it allows companies to position ahead of their competitors and eventually increase their earnings.
