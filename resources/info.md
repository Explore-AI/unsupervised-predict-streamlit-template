###  How it works

This process requires the user to input three 
favourite movies, and from these inputs the system will 
recommend a movie for the user to watch next. Exploratory 
data analysis can be viewed on the EDA page, and recommendations
for a movie can be made on the "recommender system" page which 
you can navigate to on the sidebar.

###  How do recommender systems work

At a fundamental level, these systems operate using similarity.
In content-based filtering this similarity is measured between items
based on their properties, while collaborative filtering uses
similarities amongst users to drive recommendations.

### Where they are applied

Search engines, online shopping, streaming multimedia platforms,
news-feeds - all these services depend on recommendation algorithms
in order to provide users the content they want to interact with.
