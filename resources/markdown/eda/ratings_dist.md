It is interesting that the ratings are left-skewed. It was expected that there would be a normal distribution with a mean rating of 3. Instead, we observe that users tend to rate movies quite favourably and tend to avoid negative ratings. This skew might be explained by the tendency of users to rate movies they liked. In other words, if a user doesn't like a movie, it is unlikely that they will watch it through to the end, let alone rate it.
