**Problem Statement**

Build a movie recommendation web app based on content and collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting movies a user might like based on their preferences.

**Problem Landscape**

In today's technology driven world, recommender systems are critical to ensuring users can make appropriate decisions about the content they engage with daily. Recommender systems help users select similar items when something is being chosen online. Netflix or Amazon would suggest different movies and titles that might interest individual users. In education, these systems may be used to suggest learning material that could improve educational outcomes. These types of algorithms lead to service improvement and customer satisfaction. Current recommendation systems - content-based filtering and collaborative filtering - use difference information sources to make recommendations.

**Data Overview**

This dataset consists of several million 5-star ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service. The MovieLens dataset has long been used by industry and academic researchers to improve the performance of explicitly-based recommender systems. For this project, we used a special version of the MovieLens dataset which has enriched with additional data, and resampled for fair evaluation purposes.
