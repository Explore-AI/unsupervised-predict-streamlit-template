### Content-based systems
These systems make recommendations using a userâ€™s movie and profile features. They hypothesize that if a user was interested in a movie in the past, they will once again be interested in it in the future. Similar items are usually grouped based on their features. User profiles are constructed using historical interactions or by explicitly asking users about their interests.
For instance, in a content-based movie recommender system, the similarity between the movies is calculated based on genres, the actors in the movie, the director of the movie, etc. 

### Collaborative filtering systems
Collaborative filtering is currently one of the most frequently used approaches and usually provides better results than content-based recommendations.
These kinds of systems utilize user interactions to filter for movies of interest. Collaborative filtering systems are based on the assumption that if a user likes movie A and another user likes the same movie A as well as another movie, movie B, the first user could also be interested in the second movie. Hence, they aim to predict new interactions based on historical ones.

This app tries to mimic an everyday simple movie recommender system that uses both algorithms to make personalised movie recommendations for various viewers to achieve an enhanced customer experience.
